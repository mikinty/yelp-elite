# Yelp Info

Information about Yelp features is not super well-documented.

The purpose of this project is to give more light on Yelp Elite and Badges.
Also just more about the community and what it's like.

There's not a lot of info on this topic that's well-collected and organized,
so here's my attempt.

## Badges

Yelp uses an achievement system to motivate their users to use their platform
more. These are essentially all check-in based, which are Yelp's way of
tracking where you visit. Badges have notoriously been known for being
inconsistent, often missing rewards or rewarding a user very late.
